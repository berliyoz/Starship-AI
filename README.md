# StarShip-AI SAI
Energy mangment game. Text based.

I have made this game after finishing about 1/3 of "Learn Ruby the hard way".
One of the exercise had too long of a list of things that I didn't manage to learn alone.
So I stop with the class and went making this game.

I think it works. but i didn't finish to balnce it.
I got to the point that I had to concentrate not to mess the code.
And then I understood why some of the more advenced tools were needed.
Happy that I got to LVL 2 as a programer I started to to make the game from scratch.
But now better by coding.
